# Crawler

## TODO

- [x] try crawling for image_urls
- [x] collect all findings from all tasks using _shared-state concurrency_
- [x] download found images
- [ ] refactor into _message-passing concurrency_
- [ ] consider using _tokio_ (reqwest) instead of _async-std_

### Github Code Crawler

- [ ] crawl github for source code
- [ ] "parse" some code (e.g. count pattern occurences)
- [ ] create statistics
